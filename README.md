# youtube_to_mp3
Convert any youtube URL to mp3.

My main source of music is Spotify, although it's great sometimes it just doesn't have some of the more niche songs and mixtapes that I often enjoy. There are already plenty of websites that allow you to convert to MP3; However I always found that when looking for them only some would work. I became frustated and decided to use my new knowledge of Python to convert them for me instead.
